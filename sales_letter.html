  // ===== A: Problem-First =====
  {id:1,c:"A",s:"Do your clients call YOU about site issues — or the other way around?",b:`Hi [Name],

Most agencies find out about GA4 anomalies the same way — their client calls them first.

Ninjalens monitors GA4 around the clock and alerts your Slack before anyone picks up the phone. Powered by Gemini AI + Z-Score anomaly detection.

14-day free trial, no credit card. 15-minute setup.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:2,c:"A",s:"What if Slack told you about site problems before 9am?",b:`Hi [Name],

Imagine starting every day with an AI-generated GA4 briefing already in your Slack — before your client's first email arrives.

That's what Ninjalens does. Every morning. Automatically.

Try free for 14 days → ninjalens.net`},
  {id:3,c:"A",s:"How many GA4 dashboards does your team check every morning?",b:`Hi [Name],

If the answer is "too many" — Ninjalens was built for you.

One tool. All your client GA4s. Automatic daily Slack alerts with AI analysis. Agency plan covers 10 clients at $499/mo.

Free trial → ninjalens.net`},
  {id:4,c:"A",s:"The GA4 drop your team missed last Tuesday",b:`Hi [Name],

Traffic drops happen. Conversion crashes happen. The question is: do you see them before your client does?

Ninjalens runs statistical anomaly detection 24/7 and pushes AI-written alerts to Slack the moment something looks wrong.

14-day trial, no card needed → ninjalens.net`},
  {id:5,c:"A",s:`"How did you catch that so fast?" — what your clients should be saying`,b:`Hi [Name],

When a site issue hits, the agency that calls first builds trust. The one that waits loses it.

Ninjalens monitors GA4 in real-time and tells your team in Slack exactly what happened, why, and what to do — before your client notices.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:6,c:"A",s:"How much of your team's time goes to GA4 check-ins?",b:`Hi [Name],

Daily GA4 reviews. Weekly reports. Hunting for anomalies.

Ninjalens automates all of it — AI analysis, anomaly detection, Slack delivery — so your team focuses on strategy, not surveillance.

Free 14-day trial → ninjalens.net`},
  {id:7,c:"A",s:"Would you know within the hour if a client's checkout broke?",b:`Hi [Name],

JS errors on checkout pages kill conversions silently. GA4 doesn't scream. Your client doesn't know. You find out too late.

Ninjalens detects JS errors via GA4 Realtime API and alerts your Slack within the hour.

→ ninjalens.net (14-day free trial)`},
  {id:8,c:"A",s:"What separates a $2k/mo agency from a $10k/mo agency?",b:`Hi [Name],

Speed and proactivity.

Agencies that spot problems first — and explain them clearly — command premium fees. Ninjalens gives your team AI-generated GA4 alerts in Slack before clients even open their dashboards.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:9,c:"A",s:"A better Monday morning for your GA4 team",b:`Hi [Name],

Instead of manually checking 10 GA4 accounts every Monday, what if Slack had already briefed your team on every anomaly — with AI analysis attached?

Ninjalens does that. Every day. Automatically.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:10,c:"A",s:`"Traffic dropped 10%" means nothing without context`,b:`Hi [Name],

A 10% drop on a Tuesday might be normal. On a Thursday after a campaign launch, it's a crisis.

Ninjalens uses Z-Score statistical analysis to tell the difference — and alerts your Slack only when it actually matters.

Free trial → ninjalens.net`},
  {id:11,c:"A",s:"Your client's site has a JS error. Do you know about it?",b:`Hi [Name],

Right now, one of your client's sites might have a broken checkout, a failing form, or a GTM error eating conversions silently.

Ninjalens catches JS errors in real-time via GA4 and pings your Slack immediately.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:12,c:"A",s:"If Ninjalens catches one conversion drop per month, it pays for itself",b:`Hi [Name],

One missed checkout bug. One undetected traffic crash. That's more lost revenue than $499/mo.

Ninjalens monitors all 10 of your client GA4s 24/7 for $499.

→ ninjalens.net (14-day free trial)`},
  {id:13,c:"A",s:"Cut your weekly GA4 reporting time to near zero",b:`Hi [Name],

Ninjalens generates AI-written daily GA4 reports — delivered to your Slack before your team starts work. No manual pulling. No formatting. Just insights.

  {id:14,c:"A",s:"While you're building reports, your competitor already sent the alert",b:`Hi [Name],

The agency that alerts clients first wins the trust game. Manual reporting can't compete with automated 24/7 monitoring.

Ninjalens runs while your team sleeps.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:15,c:"A",s:"15-minute setup. 24/7 GA4 monitoring.",b:`Hi [Name],

No server. No code. No maintenance.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:16,c:"A",s:"Your clients will think you have a dedicated monitoring team",b:`Hi [Name],

They don't need to know it's automated.

Ninjalens delivers white-labeled GA4 alerts in your agency's name — so your clients think you're watching 24/7. (You are. Just not manually.)

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:17,c:"A",s:"Something just happened on your client's site. Are you finding out at 9am?",b:`Hi [Name],

Site issues don't wait for business hours. Revenue drops don't either.

Ninjalens monitors GA4 around the clock and alerts your Slack the moment a statistical anomaly appears.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:18,c:"A",s:"GA4 is powerful. It's also a daily time sink.",b:`Hi [Name],

Dashboard checks, custom reports, client updates — GA4 management eats hours your team could spend on strategy.

Ninjalens automates the monitoring layer entirely. AI does the analysis. Slack gets the report.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:19,c:"A",s:"Adding a 10th GA4 client shouldn't mean 10x more monitoring work",b:`Hi [Name],

Ninjalens scales with you. One Agency plan covers 10 clients — same effort, regardless of portfolio size.

→ ninjalens.net (14-day free trial, no card)`},
  {id:20,c:"A",s:"Client's revenue dropped 40% last night. When do you find out?",b:`Hi [Name],

Without monitoring: Tomorrow morning, when they call.
With Ninjalens: Within the hour, via Slack — with AI analysis already explaining why.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:26,c:"B",s:"Stop giving away monitoring work for free",b:`Hi [Name],

  // ===== F: Story =====
  {id:81,c:"F",s:`"Why didn't you tell us sooner?" — a conversation no one wants`,b:`Hi [Name],

We built Ninjalens after watching agencies lose clients over preventable GA4 incidents — traffic drops, conversion crashes, JS errors — all discovered too late.

If your team manages multiple GA4 properties, this tool was made for you.

14-day free trial → ninjalens.net`},
  {id:82,c:"F",s:"The Monday morning no one wants",b:`Hi [Name],

It's 9am Monday. A client's site had a checkout error all weekend. Revenue dropped 60%. They're about to call.

Ninjalens would have alerted your Slack on Friday night.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:83,c:"F",s:"Your best analyst can't watch 10 GA4 dashboards at 3am.",b:`Hi [Name],

But Ninjalens can. And it'll summarize what it found — with AI analysis — before your team starts their day.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:84,c:"F",s:`"We noticed something in your GA4 last night and wanted to reach out."`,b:`Hi [Name],

That's the message your clients want to receive. Ninjalens makes it easy to send — because the alert already came to your Slack.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:85,c:"F",s:"Not every traffic drop is a crisis. Ninjalens knows the difference.",b:`Hi [Name],

Normal daily fluctuation vs. genuine statistical anomaly — Ninjalens uses Z-Score to tell them apart and only alerts when it matters.

No alert fatigue. Just real signals.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:86,c:"F",s:"One small tool. Massive impact on client relationships.",b:`Hi [Name],

The agencies that retain clients longest aren't the ones with the best decks — they're the ones who catch problems first.

Ninjalens is how you do that at scale.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:87,c:"F",s:"The Slack message your team wants to start every day with",b:`Hi [Name],

"Here's what happened in GA4 last night. One anomaly detected. Here's what it is and what to do."

That's Ninjalens. Every morning.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:88,c:"F",s:"What would you do with 5 extra hours per week?",b:`Hi [Name],

That's roughly what agencies save when they stop doing manual GA4 check-ins.

Ninjalens automates the monitoring. Your team reclaims the time.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:89,c:"F",s:"Your clients are paying you to know their site. Do you?",b:`Hi [Name],

GA4 doesn't push alerts. Clients don't always notice issues. But you're expected to.

Ninjalens closes that gap — automatically, daily, in Slack.

→ ninjalens.net`},
  {id:90,c:"F",s:"14 days to see if Ninjalens changes how your agency works",b:`Hi [Name],

No credit card. Full Agency features. 10 client properties.

If it doesn't feel indispensable by day 14, you owe us nothing.

  {id:94,c:"G",s:"For SEO agencies: traffic dropped. Was it Google or a site issue?",b:`Hi [Name],
